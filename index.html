    <h4>I am a new, curious designer and I am still trying to discover all of my abilities.
      I am unique using minimalistic style with colours, typically soft / pastel.
      I like to be descriptive through design, the beauty is in the eye of the beholder,
      and it gives more space for interpretation this way. I’m very easily distracted so
      my designs take time, I do believe that I work on them until I am happy and satisfied
      with what I had visioned. I like to keep things simple, to avoid reason for extra
      distraction. I believe the colours I chose are those of which represent me the
      most, they’re some of my favourites. The lilac represents euphoria, and the mint
      represents comfort.
